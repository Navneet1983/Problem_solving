/*
  
  In this problem we need to find out the maximum consecutive 1's in a array.
  
  i/p arr[] = { 0,1,1,0,1,1,1 }
   
   o/p = 3; 
   
   to solve this problem we will we should have two variable 
   1. current 
   2. result 
   
   every tiime when we get value 0 we will made current = 0  and when we get 1, we will increment the current and compare with result and store the whoever is maximum to result.
  with these approach we can store o/p to the result and we will achieve our our output in 0(n).
