    In this problem we have and Array which is denoting the BAR of a unit.
    in between the Bar we can store the water, here we need to find out 
    how much water we can store in between the BAR.
    
    To solve this problem we need to find out the max element of left most corner and 
    max element of right most corner. this we need find out for each and every element.
    and store all the value of Lmax and Rmax in array.
