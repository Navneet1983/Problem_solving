/*
    This file contain the function to move all the zeroes to right side of the array.
    Time Complexity O(n).
    
    In this problem we will take the count of Non-Zero number, the value of count is nothing but the index of First_zero_element.
    
    whenever the next time we got the Non-zero element we will swap the element with Count index.
    
    with that approach we will get all the zeroes to the right side.

void move_zero_to_right ( int a[], int size )
{

  int count = 0;
  
  for ( int i=0; i<size; i++ )
  {
    if ( a[i]!=0 )
    {
        swap ( a[i], a[count] );
        count++;
    }
  }
}

For the swap function we need to include the header file  #include<algorithm>.
