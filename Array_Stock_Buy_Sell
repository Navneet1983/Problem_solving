/*

In this problem we already know the prize of stock in upcoming days.
we can buy the stock at any day but we need to sell that in any upcoming days.
we have to make maximum profit out of it.

To solve that this problem we need to buy the stock it has a low price and sell than it has high price .
for selling we need to see whether stock price of today is greater next day than we can sell that.

  In Above program we are actually adding the difference between a[i] - a[i-1] if a[i] > a[i-1];
  if we do that in a single loop we will add all the profit in one shot.
